### Meeting 3

in this section, we learn about setup linter for pyhton using Ruff

```
uv add ruff --dev

uv run ruff check

uv run ruff che
```

Run on browser
```
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then, practical with SQLMODEL ORM and Alembic use sqlite db.

- script/seeder.py is script for seed db made by AI, run with command : uv run script/seeder.py
- logic_return_date.py is explanation about logic function is_available() on models.py

Thanks.
